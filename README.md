# AZOM PROD LANDING

Managed to build a landing page for photographers. Created a complex layout with the help of CSS Grid and HTML. Focused on the dark theme, since it is a popular approach nowadays. Created beautiful animations for the hamburger button, navigation menu. Built Tabbed components, popup windows and slider with vanilla javascript DOM manipulations. The biggest goal making the page responsive for all devices was achieved through writing multiple Media Queries and using relative size units, rem in this case.
